 * ======================================================================================
 * LOGIC EXPLANATION: The Math Behind Couple-Bachelor-Spinster Numbers
 * ======================================================================================
 *
 * THE CORE IDENTITY:
 * The problem asks if a number N can be expressed as aÂ² - bÂ². The key is to
 * factor the right side using the difference of squares identity:
 *   N = aÂ² - bÂ² = (a - b) * (a + b)
 *
 * Let's call the factors k1 = (a - b) and k2 = (a + b). So, N = k1 * k2.
 * Our goal is to find non-negative integers a and b that satisfy this.
 *
 * A CRUCIAL PROPERTY:
 * The two factors, k1 and k2, must have the same parity (both even or both odd).
 * Why? Their difference is k2 - k1 = (a + b) - (a - b) = 2b, which is always even.
 * The difference between two integers is even only if they are both even or both odd.
 *
 * This property allows us to solve the problem by considering two cases based on N's parity.
 *
 * CASE 1: N is an ODD number.
 * --------------------------------
 * If N is odd, its factors (k1 and k2) must also be odd.
 * We can choose the simplest possible factors: k1 = 1 and k2 = N.
 * This gives us a system of two equations:
 *   a - b = 1
 *   a + b = N
 *
 * Solving this system (e.g., by adding the two equations) gives:
 *   2a = N + 1  =>  a = (N + 1) / 2
 *   2b = N - 1  =>  b = (N - 1) / 2
 *
 * Since N is odd, (N+1) and (N-1) are both even, guaranteeing that 'a' and 'b'
 * will always be integers.
 * CONCLUSION: Every positive ODD number is a square-couple number.
 *
 * CASE 2: N is an EVEN number.
 * --------------------------------
 * If N is even, its factors (k1 and k2) must both be even (as they must have
 * the same parity).
 * Let's choose the simplest possible even factors: k1 = 2 and k2 = N / 2.
 * This gives us a system of equations:
 *   a - b = 2
 *   a + b = N / 2
 *
 * Solving this system gives:
 *   2a = N/2 + 2  =>  a = (N / 4) + 1
 *   2b = N/2 - 2  =>  b = (N / 4) - 1
 *
 * For 'a' and 'b' to be integers, N must be divisible by 4. If it's not, N/4 will
 * not be an integer and the solution fails.
 * CONCLUSION: An EVEN number is a square-couple number if and only if it is a
 * MULTIPLE OF 4.
 *
 * THE FINAL CLASSIFICATION (Bachelor Numbers):
 * =================================================
 * - If N is ODD, it's a square-couple.
 * - If N is a MULTIPLE OF 4, it's a square-couple.
 * - The only remaining case is numbers that are EVEN but NOT a multiple of 4.
 *   These are numbers of the form 4k + 2. These are the BACHELOR NUMBERS.
 *
 * (Note: N=0 is a special case. 0 = 0Â²-0Â², so it's a square-couple.)

      Allen has a LOT of money. He has 洧녵 dollars in the bank. 
      For security reasons, he wants to withdraw it in cash (we will not disclose the reasons here). 
      The denominations for dollar bills are 1, 5, 10, 20, 100. 
      What is the minimum number of bills Allen could receive after withdrawing his entire balance?

       It is pretty simple to see that we can operate greedily: take as many 100 as we can, then 20, then 10, etc.
       The solutions works because each number in the sequence 1, 5, 10, 20, 100 is a divisor of the number after it.

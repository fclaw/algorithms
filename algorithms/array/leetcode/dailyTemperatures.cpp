    // Given an array of integers temperatures represents the daily temperatures, 
    // return an array answer such that answer[i] is the number of days you have to wait after 
    // the ith day to get a warmer temperature. 
    // If there is no future day for which this is possible, keep answer[i] == 0 instead.
    // Hint: using stack the problem can be effectively solved in a linear time

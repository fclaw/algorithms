    /**
     * https://leetcode.com/problems/path-with-minimum-effort
     * You are a hiker preparing for an upcoming hike. 
     * You are given heights, a 2D array of size rows x columns, where heights[row][col] 
     * represents the height of cell (row, col). 
     * You are situated in the top-left cell, (0, 0), and 
     * you hope to travel to the bottom-right cell, (rows-1, columns-1) (i.e., 0-indexed). 
     * You can move up, down, left, or right, and you wish to find a route that requires the minimum effort.
     * A route's effort is the maximum absolute difference in heights between two consecutive cells of the route.
     * Return the minimum effort required to travel from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell. 
     * hints: 
     *  - Consider the grid as a graph, where adjacent cells have an edge with cost of the difference between the cells
     *  - If you are given threshold k, check if it is possible to go from (0, 0) to (n-1, m-1) using only edges of â‰¤ k cost
     *  - Binary search the k value */

# Algorithmic Problem-Solving in C++

A comprehensive and structured portfolio of my solutions to competitive programming challenges from various online judges, including UVa Online Judge, Codeforces (in future), and Kattis.

## Overview

This repository serves as a living document of my dedicated and systematic study of fundamental computer science concepts.
## Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to bridge the gap between theoretical knowledge and practical application. By solving these challenges, I aim to:

-   **Master Core Algorithms:** Develop a deep, intuitive understanding of key algorithms and data structures.
-   **Hone C++ Skills:** Practice writing high-performance, memory-efficient, and robust C++ code under timed conditions.
-   **Build a Problem-Solving Mindset:** Enhance my ability to analyze complex problems, devise efficient solutions, and handle intricate edge cases.
-   **Prepare for Contests:** Systematically work through material (inspired by resources like CP3/CP4) with the goal of participating in high-level programming contests.

## Key Areas of Focus

While the repository covers a broad range of topics, there is a strong emphasis on:

*   **Graph Theory:** Shortest Paths (Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall), Traversal (BFS, DFS), Minimum Spanning Trees, State-Space Search.
*   **Dynamic Programming:** From classic introductory problems to more complex variations with state optimization.
*   **Data Structures:** Efficient use and implementation of both standard and custom data structures.
*   **Computational Mathematics:** Number theory, combinatorics, and computational geometry.

## Repository Structure

Solutions are organized into directories based on the online judge platform or the primary algorithmic topic they represent. This structure is intended to make navigation easy and to group related concepts together.

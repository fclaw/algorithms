 * =====================================================================================
 *
 * --- Analysis: Deconstructing the Problem with a Tree Model ---
 *
 * The whimsical "Cat in the Hat" story describes a recursive, hierarchical structure
 * that can be perfectly modeled as a full, rooted N-ary tree. The key to solving
 * the problem is to translate the story's elements into tree properties and then
 * solve for the tree's unknown parameters.
 *
 * As outlined in the initial sketch, the problem boils down to solving a system of
 * two equations with two unknowns.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 1: Translate Story Elements to Tree Terminology ###
 *
 *   - "Initial cat": The ROOT of the tree.
 *   - "Cats with hats": The INTERNAL NODES of the tree.
 *   - "Cats without hats" (workers): The LEAF NODES of the tree.
 *   - `N` (cats inside a hat): The BRANCHING FACTOR. Every internal node has N children.
 *   - `H` (initial cat height): The height attribute of the root node.
 *   - `W` (worker cats): The total number of leaf nodes.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 2: Formulate the First Equation (Based on Cat Counts) ###
 *
 * The structure is a full N-ary tree. Let `d` be the depth of the tree, where the
 * root is at depth 0 and the leaves are at depth `d`.
 *
 *   - The number of nodes at depth `i` is `N^i`.
 *   - The leaves are all at depth `d`. Therefore, the number of worker cats `W` is
 *     equal to the number of nodes at depth `d`.
 *
 *   >> Equation 1:  W = N^d
 *
 *
 * ### Step 3: Formulate the Second Equation (Based on Cat Heights) ###
 *
 * The height of a child cat is `1/(N+1)` times the height of its parent.
 *
 *   - Height at depth 0 (root): `H`
 *   - Height at depth 1: `H / (N+1)`
 *   - Height at depth `i`: `H / (N+1)^i`
 *
 * The smallest cats (leaves) are at depth `d` and have a height of 1.
 *   `Height at depth d = H / (N+1)^d = 1`
 *
 * Rearranging this gives our second key equation:
 *
 *   >> Equation 2:  H = (N+1)^d
 *
 *
 * ### Step 4: Solving the System of Equations ###
 *
 * As the sketch correctly concludes, we are given `H` and `W`, and we need to find
 * the two integer unknowns, `N` and `d`. A direct algebraic solution is complex, but
 * a simple search is very efficient.
 *
 * We can iterate on the depth `d` (from 1 upwards). For each `d`, we can calculate a
 * candidate `N` from one equation and verify it with the other.
 *
 * From Equation 1: `N = W^(1/d)`
 * From Equation 2: `N+1 = H^(1/d)`
 *
 * The algorithm is to find a `d` for which `round(W^(1/d)) + 1` is equal to
 * `round(H^(1/d))`. This `d` and the corresponding `N` define the tree's structure.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 5: Calculating the Final Answers ###
 *
 * Once `N` and `d` are known, we can calculate the two required outputs.
 *
 *   1. Number of Non-Working Cats (Internal Nodes):
 *      This is the sum of nodes at depths 0 to d-1: `N^0 + N^1 + ... + N^(d-1)`.
 *      This is a geometric series which sums to `(N^d - 1) / (N - 1)`. Since `W = N^d`,
 *      the formula is simply `(W - 1) / (N - 1)`.
 *
 *   2. Total Height of All Cats (Sum of all node heights):
 *      Sum = âˆ‘_{i=0 to d} [ (Nodes at depth i) * (Height at depth i) ]
 *      Sum = âˆ‘_{i=0 to d} [ N^i * (H / (N+1)^i) ] = H * âˆ‘ [ N/(N+1) ]^i
 *      This geometric series simplifies to the elegant formula `(N+1) * H - N * W`.

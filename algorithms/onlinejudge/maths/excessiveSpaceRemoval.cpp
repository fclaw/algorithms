 * --- Analysis: From String Simulation to a Logarithmic Formula ---
 *
 * The problem describes a process of repeatedly applying a "replace all" action, where
 * every occurrence of two consecutive spaces ("  ") is replaced by a single space (" ").
 * We need to find the total number of actions required until no more changes can be made.
 *
 * A direct simulation of the string replacement would be too slow and complex. The key
 * is to find a mathematical pattern in the process.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 1: Analyze a Single Block of Spaces ###
 *
 * Let's consider a block of `S` consecutive spaces.
 *   - After 1 action, `S` spaces become `ceil(S / 2.0)` spaces.
 *   - After 2 actions, they become `ceil(ceil(S / 2.0) / 2.0)` spaces.
 *
 * This is a process of repeatedly taking the ceiling of a division by two. The number
 * of times this must be done until the result is 1 is the definition of the
 * ceiling of the base-2 logarithm: `ceil(logâ‚‚(S))`.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 2: The Critical Insight - The Largest Block Dictates the Pace ###
 *
 * The "replace all" action is applied to all blocks of spaces in the string
 * simultaneously in each step.
 *
 *   - A small block of spaces (e.g., 2 spaces) will be resolved quickly (in 1 action).
 *   - A larger block of spaces (e.g., 8 spaces) will take longer (3 actions).
 *
 * The process only stops when ALL blocks are resolved (i.e., contain no "  " pairs).
 * Therefore, the total number of actions required for the entire string is determined
 * by the single block of spaces that takes the most actions to resolve. This will
 * always be the largest block of consecutive spaces.
 *
 *
 * ### Final O(L) Algorithm (where L is the length of the string) ###
 *
 * The problem elegantly reduces to a simple, two-step algorithm:
 *
 * 1.  **Find the Maximum Length:**
 *     - Iterate through the input string once to find the maximum number of
 *       consecutive spaces. Let this be `S_max`.
 *
 * 2.  **Apply the Logarithm:**
 *     - The total number of actions is `ceil(logâ‚‚(S_max))`.
 *
 * This can be calculated using floating-point math (`ceil(log2(S_max))`) or, more
 * robustly, with a simple integer loop that simulates the halving process on `S_max`.
 *
 * Example: `S_max = 9`
 *   actions = 0
 *   while (9 > 1): actions++, S_max = (9+1)/2 = 5
 *   while (5 > 1): actions++, S_max = (5+1)/2 = 3
 *   while (3 > 1): actions++, S_max = (3+1)/2 = 2
 *   while (2 > 1): actions++, S_max = (2+1)/2 = 1. Loop terminates.
 *   Final actions = 4.  (Which is `ceil(logâ‚‚(9))`).
 *
 * This approach solves the problem efficiently with a single pass over the string.

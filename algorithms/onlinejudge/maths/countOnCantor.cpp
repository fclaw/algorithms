 * --- Analysis: An O(1) Mathematical Solution ---
 *
 * The problem asks for the N-th rational number in a sequence that traverses a 2D
 * grid of fractions in a diagonal, zig-zag pattern. A direct simulation that iterates
 * term by term is too slow (O(N)), given N can be up to 10^7.
 *
 * The elegant solution is to find a direct mathematical formula by analyzing the
 * properties of the diagonals.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 1: Identify the Role of Triangular Numbers ###
 *
 * The path is structured in diagonals. Let's number them starting from k=1.
 * - Diagonal k=1: (1/1). Contains 1 term. Total terms up to here: 1.
 * - Diagonal k=2: (1/2, 2/1). Contains 2 terms. Total terms up to here: 1+2 = 3.
 * - Diagonal k=3: (3/1, 2/2, 1/3). Contains 3 terms. Total terms up to here: 1+2+3 = 6.
 *
 * The total number of terms up to the end of the k-th diagonal is the k-th
 * triangular number, T_k = k * (k + 1) / 2.
 *
 * Our first task is to find which diagonal `k` the N-th term falls on.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 2: Find the Diagonal Number `k` ###
 *
 * We are looking for the smallest integer `k` such that the N-th term is included
 * within the first `k` diagonals. Mathematically, this is the smallest `k` for which:
 *   N <= T_k
 *   N <= k * (k + 1) / 2
 *
 * Rearranging this gives a standard quadratic inequality:
 *   2N <= k^2 + k
 *   k^2 + k - 2N >= 0
 *
 * We can find the positive root of the corresponding equation k^2 + k - 2N = 0 using
 * the quadratic formula: k = (-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)) / 2a.
 *   k_float = (-1 + sqrt(1 - 4*1*(-2N))) / 2
 *   k_float = (-1 + sqrt(1 + 8N)) / 2
 *
 * Since `k` must be the smallest integer satisfying the inequality, our answer for the
 * diagonal number is the ceiling of this floating-point result:
 *   k = ceil(k_float)
 *
 *
 * ### Step 3: Find the Term's Position Within the Diagonal ###
 *
 * Once we know the diagonal number `k`, we need to find out how many steps `pos` we
 * are into that diagonal.
 *
 * - The total number of terms BEFORE our diagonal `k` began is T_{k-1}.
 *   Terms_before = (k - 1) * k / 2
 *
 * - The position of our term N along the diagonal is therefore:
 *   pos = N - Terms_before
 *
 *
 * ### Step 4: Determine Numerator and Denominator from Parity ###
 *
 * The direction of traversal along a diagonal depends on whether `k` is even or odd.
 *
 * - If `k` is EVEN: The path moves from bottom-left to top-right.
 *   The sequence of terms is (k/1), (k-1/2), (k-2/3), ... , (1/k).
 *   The numerator starts at `k` and decreases, while the denominator starts at `1` and increases.
 *     - Numerator = k - pos + 1
 *     - Denominator = pos
 *
 * - If `k` is ODD: The path moves from top-right to bottom-left.
 *   The sequence of terms is (1/k), (2/k-1), (3/k-2), ... , (k/1).
 *   The numerator starts at `1` and increases, while the denominator starts at `k` and decreases.
 *     - Numerator = pos
 *     - Denominator = k - pos + 1
 *
 * By implementing these four steps, we can directly calculate the N-th term in O(1)
 * time per test case, avoiding any slow loops.

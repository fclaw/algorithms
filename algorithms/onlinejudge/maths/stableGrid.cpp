 * --- Analysis: The Pigeonhole Principle ---
 *
 * The problem asks if we can rearrange the numbers in each row of an N x N grid
 * such that no column has repeated values. This appears to be a complex permutation
 * or matching problem. However, the constraints and the nature of the condition allow
 * for a much simpler solution.
 *
 *
 * ### The Key Insight: Necessary vs. Sufficient Conditions ###
 *
 * Instead of trying to construct a stable arrangement (which would be very difficult),
 * let's find a simple "necessary" condition. If this necessary condition is not met,
 * then a solution is impossible.
 *
 * Consider a single number, let's say the number 7. Let's count its total occurrences
 * across the entire N x N grid. Let this count be `count(7)`.
 *
 * In any valid "stable" arrangement, these `count(7)` instances of the number 7 must
 * be placed in the grid. Since we can only permute numbers within their own rows,
 * each 7 will remain in its original row.
 *
 * The crucial constraint is that after rearrangement, each column can have at most ONE
 * instance of the number 7. Since there are N columns, this means that in total, we
 * can place at most N sevens in the final grid without any column conflicts.
 *
 *
 * ### The Pigeonhole Principle ###
 *
 * This leads directly to a Pigeonhole Principle argument:
 *
 *   - The numbers (e.g., all the 7s) are the "pigeons".
 *   - The N columns are the "pigeonholes".
 *   - The rule is that no two pigeons (of the same value) can be in the same pigeonhole.
 *
 * If the number of pigeons (`count(7)`) is greater than the number of pigeonholes (`N`),
 * then by the Pigeonhole Principle, at least one pigeonhole (column) must contain
 * more than one pigeon. This would violate the stability condition.
 *
 * Therefore, a NECESSARY condition for the grid to be stable is that for ANY number `v`
 * present in the grid, its total frequency must not exceed N.
 *   `count(v) <= N` for all `v`.
 *
 *
 * ### Is the Condition Sufficient? ###
 *
 * The problem now is: is this condition also sufficient? If `count(v) <= N` for all
 * numbers `v`, are we guaranteed to find a stable arrangement? The answer comes
 * from a famous theorem in combinatorics related to systems of distinct
 * representatives, Hall's Marriage Theorem. It can be shown that this condition
 * is indeed sufficient.
 *
 * Therefore, the problem simplifies from a complex arrangement task to a simple
 * frequency counting task.
 *
 *
 * ### The Algorithm ###
 *
 * 1. Read N and the N x N grid.
 * 2. Use a hash map (or an array, since numbers are <= 100) to store the frequency
 *    of every number in the entire grid.
 * 3. Iterate through the frequencies. If any number's frequency is greater than N,
 *    the grid is not stable.
 * 4. If all numbers have a frequency less than or equal to N, the grid is stable.
 *
 * This transforms the problem into a simple O(N^2) pass to count frequencies.
 * Your provided code has a logical flaw in its counting loop, but the idea is right.
 * A single pass to build the frequency map is all that's needed.

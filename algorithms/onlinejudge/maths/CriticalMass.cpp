ðŸ§³ UVa 580 Critical Mass, related to Tribonacci series; Tribonacci numbers
   are the generalization of Fibonacci numbers; it is defined by T1 = 1, T2 = 1,

 * --- Problem-Solving Strategy for UVa 580 - Critical Mass ---
 *
 * This is a classic combinatorial counting problem. The goal is to find the number of
 * binary sequences of length N that contain at least one block of 3 or more consecutive
 * 'URANIUM's (let's say '1's).
 *
 * PHASE 1: EMPIRICAL DISCOVERY VIA BACKTRACKING
 * A direct mathematical formula is not immediately obvious. The constraints on N (up to 31)
 * are small enough to allow for a more direct, computational approach first.
 *
 * 1.  Backtracking with Memoization (Top-Down DP):
 *     A recursive function was written to build all 2^N sequences. The state for the
 *     memoization was (current_length, consecutive_uraniums, has_critical_block_been_found).
 *
 * 2.  Generating the Sequence:
 *     This correct but slow approach was used to generate the first ~30 terms of the
 *     answer sequence. The output began: 0, 0, 1, 3, 8, 20, 47, 107, 238, 520, ...
 *
 * PHASE 2: PATTERN RECOGNITION (THE "AHA!" MOMENT)
 *
 * 1.  The OEIS (On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences):
 *     The generated sequence was plugged into the OEIS at https://oeis.org/.
 *
 * 2.  The Match:
 *     The sequence was a perfect match for A050231, described as "the number of n-tosses
 *     of a fair coin having a run of 3 or more heads." This is a mathematical isomorphism
 *     of our problem (URANIUM = Heads, LEAD = Tails).
 *
 * PHASE 3: THE ELEGANT COMBINATORIAL SOLUTION
 *
 * The OEIS entry provides a much more efficient formula based on a common combinatorial
 * technique: counting the complement.
 *
 * Total Sequences = 2^N
 * "Safe" Sequences = Number of sequences with NO run of 3 or more URANIUMs.
 * Answer = Total Sequences - "Safe" Sequences
 *
 * The number of "safe" sequences follows a Tribonacci-like recurrence relation.
 * Let S(n) be the number of safe sequences of length n:
 *   - A safe sequence of length n can be formed by adding:
 *     - 'L' to any safe sequence of length n-1.
 *     - 'LU' to any safe sequence of length n-2.
 *     - 'LUU' to any safe sequence of length n-3.
 *   - This gives the recurrence: S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) + S(n-3).
 *
 * The final implementation calculates S(n) using a simple DP loop and then
 * computes (2^n - S(n)) for the final answer. This is an efficient O(N) solution.

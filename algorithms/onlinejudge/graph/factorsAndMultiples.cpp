 * =====================================================================================
 * ALGORITHMIC STRATEGY: UVa 11159 - Factors and Multiples
 * =====================================================================================
 *
 * This problem asks for the minimum number of integers to remove from two sets, A and B,
 * such that no remaining number in B is a multiple of any remaining number in A.
 * At first glance, this is a complex optimization problem. The key is to correctly
 * model it using graph theory, which reveals a direct path to an efficient solution.
 *
 * --- Step 1: Re-framing as a Minimum Vertex Cover Problem ---
 *
 * The core of the problem is a set of "conflicts." A conflict exists between a number
 * `a` from set A and `b` from set B if `b % a == 0`. We want to eliminate all such
 * conflicts by removing the minimum number of numbers (from A or B).
 *
 * This is a perfect mapping to the MINIMUM VERTEX COVER (MVC) problem:
 *   - The numbers in sets A and B are the VERTICES of a graph.
 *   - The "conflicts" are the EDGES of the graph.
 *   - Removing a number is equivalent to removing a VERTEX.
 *   - The goal is to select the minimum number of vertices such that every edge is
 *     "touched" or "covered" by at least one selected vertex.
 *
 * --- Step 2: Recognizing the Bipartite Structure ---
 *
 * The graph we've defined has a special structure. Edges only exist between numbers
 * from set A and numbers from set B. There are no edges connecting two numbers within
 * set A, or two numbers within set B. This is the definition of a BIPARTITE GRAPH.
 *   - Left Set (L): The `n` numbers from set A.
 *   - Right Set (R): The `m` numbers from set B.
 *
 * The problem is now: "Find the size of the MVC on a Bipartite Graph."
 *
 * --- Step 3: The "Dual" Problem - Maximum Independent Set (MIS) ---
 *
 * An alternative way to view the problem is to ask: "What is the maximum number
 * of elements we can KEEP such that no conflicts exist?" A set of vertices with
 * no edges between them is an INDEPENDENT SET. This dual view frames the problem
 * as finding the MAXIMUM INDEPENDENT SET (MIS).
 *
 * By Gallai's Identity, for any graph: `Size(MIS) + Size(MVC) = |V|`.
 * This means `Size(MVC) = |V| - Size(MIS)`. Maximizing the "keeps" (MIS) is the
 * same as minimizing the "removals" (MVC).
 *
 * --- Step 4: The Final Leap - Konig's Theorem and MCBM ---
 *
 * Finding MVC or MIS is NP-hard for general graphs. However, for BIPARTITE graphs,
 * there is a powerful shortcut provided by Konig's Theorem:
 *
 *     Size(Minimum Vertex Cover) = Size(Maximum Cardinality Bipartite Matching)
 *
 * This is the crucial insight. Instead of solving the difficult MVC problem directly,
 * we can solve for the MAXIMUM CARDINALITY BIPARTITE MATCHING (MCBM), for which
 * efficient polynomial-time algorithms (like the augmenting path method) exist.
 *
 * The size of the MCBM is our final answer. It directly gives us the size of the
 * MVC, which is the minimum number of elements we need to remove.

      https://leetcode.com/problems/knight-dialer
      Given an integer n, return how many distinct phone numbers of length n we can dial.
      You are allowed to place the knight on any numeric cell initially and 
      then you should perform n - 1 jumps to dial a number of length n. All jumps should be valid knight jumps.
      As the answer may be very large, return the answer modulo 109 + 7.

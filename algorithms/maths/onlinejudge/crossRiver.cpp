     * You are trying to cross a river of width d meters. You are given that, the river flows at v m/s and
     * you know that you can speed up the boat in u m/s. There may be two goals how to cross the river:
     * One goal (called fastest path) is to cross it in fastest time, and it does not matter how far the flow of
     * the river takes the boat. The other goal (called shortest path) is to steer the boat in a direction so that
     * the flow of the river doesnâ€™t take the boat away, and the boat passes the river in a line perpendicular to
     * the boarder of the river. Is it always possible to have two different paths, one to pass at shortest time
     * and the other at shortest path? If possible then, what is the difference (Let P s) between the times
     * needed to cross the river in the different ways? */

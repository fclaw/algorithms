     * The first line of the input contains a single number indicating the number of test cases that follow.
     * Each test case starts with a line containing two numbers m and n (2 ≤ m, n ≤ 8), the length m
     * and the width n of the cobblestone path. Then follow m lines, each containing n characters (‘A’ to ‘Z’,
     * ‘@’, ‘#’), the engravement of the respective cobblestone. Indy’s starting position is marked with the ‘@’
     * character in the last line, the destination with the character ‘#’ in the first line of the cobblestone path.
     * Each of the letters in ‘IEHOVA’ and the characters ‘@’ and ‘#’ appear exactly once in each test case.
     * There will always be exactly one path from Indy’s starting position via the stones with the letters
     * ‘IEHOVA’ engraved on (in that order) to the destination. There will be no other way to safely reach the destination.

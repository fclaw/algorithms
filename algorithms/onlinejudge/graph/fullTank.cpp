 * ðŸ§³ UVa 11367 Full Tank?, rt: s
 *
 * Problem Summary:
 * ----------------
 * Given a graph where each node (city) has a fuel price per litre and
 * each edge represents a road with a fuel cost (in litres), find the
 * minimum cost to travel from city `s` to city `t` with a car that has
 * a fuel tank of capacity `C`.
 *
 * Constraints:
 * ------------
 * - We can refuel any amount up to the tank's capacity, one litre at a time.
 * - Each refuel action at city `u` costs `fuel_price[u]` per litre.
 * - Fuel is consumed only while travelling (edges have weights in litres).
 * - Graph is sparse (up to 1,000 nodes and 10,000 edges), but the number
 *   of states is large due to the fuel dimension.
 *
 * Approach:
 * ---------
 * The graph is implicit: nodes are of the form (city, fuel_left).
 * Total number of states = n cities Ã— (C + 1) fuel levels.
 *
 * We use a Dijkstra-like algorithm over state-space:
 *   - Each state is a tuple: (total_cost, city, fuel)
 *   - Transitions:
 *       1. Buy fuel: move to (city, fuel + 1) with +fuel_price[city] cost.
 *       2. Drive: if fuel â‰¥ road_length, move to (neigh, fuel - road_length)
 *   - Only generate neighbours on the fly (graph is generated lazily).
 *   - Priority queue ordered by cost for Dijkstra's greedy step.
 *   - Track dist[city][fuel] to avoid reprocessing higher-cost paths.
 *
 * Notes:
 * ------
 * - The classic Dijkstra abstraction does not work here due to the
 *   state-space being multi-dimensional and implicit.
 * - An ad-hoc implementation is necessary to handle custom state transitions.

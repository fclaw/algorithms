 * --- Problem Analysis for UVa 11270 - Tiling Dominoes ---
 *
 * STATUS: Not solved yet. This problem has been identified as requiring advanced
 * techniques beyond standard DP, and has been "put on ice" pending further study.
 * This comment documents the investigation and the path to a future solution.
 *
 * --- THE PROBLEM ---
 * The goal is to count the number of ways to perfectly tile a general m x n grid
 * with 2x1 dominoes. The constraints (m, n <= 100) make this a computationally
 * hard problem.
 *
 * --- PHASE 1: ATTEMPTED STRATEGIES & WHY THEY FAILED ---
 *
 * 1.  INITIAL HYPOTHESIS: Discover a sequence via backtracking.
 *     - A backtracking solver was written to exhaustively find all tilings for
 *       small grids (e.g., 2x2, 2x4, 4x4).
 *     - RESULT: The backtracking was astronomically slow. It could only solve
 *       trivial cases (like 2x2=2, 4x4=36) and timed out indefinitely for anything
 *       larger, like 6x6.
 *     - CONCLUSION: It is computationally infeasible to generate a sequence long
 *       enough to be uniquely identified by the OEIS using this method. The standard
 *       "discover, identify, optimize" pipeline is defeated.
 *
 * 2.  SECOND HYPOTHESIS: Divide and Conquer.
 *     - An attempt was made to solve a 4x4 grid by breaking it into two 2x4 subproblems.
 *     - The number of ways to tile a 4x4 is 36. The number for a 2x4 is 5.
 *     - `5 * 5 = 25`, which is not 36.
 *     - CONCLUSION: The subproblems are not independent. Vertical dominoes can cross
 *       the boundary between the subgrids, creating "interlocking" tilings that a
 *       simple multiplication cannot account for.
 *
 * --- PHASE 2: IDENTIFYING THE TRUE NATURE OF THE PROBLEM ---
 *
 * This problem is a well-known, difficult challenge in both combinatorics and
 * computer science. It belongs to a specific class of "Advanced DP".
 *
 * 1.  THE CORRECT TECHNIQUE: Dynamic Programming with Profile (or "Broken Profile DP").
 *     - The flaw in simple DP is that `dp[i][j]` doesn't carry enough information.
 *       The solution for a column depends on how tiles from the *previous* column
 *       are protruding into the *current* column.
 *     - The state must therefore encode the "profile" of the boundary between the
 *       tiled and untiled sections of the grid.
 *
 * 2.  THE DP STATE: `dp[column][mask]`
 *     - `column`: The current column we are trying to tile.
 *     - `mask`: A bitmask of length 'm' (number of rows). The i-th bit is 1 if the
 *       cell (i, column) is already occupied by a horizontal domino from the
 *       previous column, and 0 otherwise.
 *
 * 3.  THE TRANSITIONS:
 *     - The transitions are complex. A recursive helper function is needed to fill
 *       the current column, row by row. It must respect the incoming 'mask' and
 *       generate the 'mask' for the next column based on the placement of new
 *       horizontal dominoes.
 *
 * --- PHASE 3: THE PATH FORWARD ---
 *
 * This problem is being set aside until the prerequisite techniques are mastered.
 *
 * 1.  PREREQUISITE: Master standard "DP with Bitmask" problems.
 *     - Problems like UVa 10911 (Forming Quiz Teams) teach the fundamentals of using
 *       a bitmask to represent a subset and writing the recursive transitions.
 *
 * 2.  NEXT STEP: Study "Profile DP" tutorials.
 *     - Once standard bitmask DP is comfortable, specific tutorials on tiling
 *       problems with profile DP can be studied to understand the state representation
 *       and the complex recursive transitions.
 *
 * 3.  THE MATHEMATICAL CONTEXT (For curiosity):
 *     - The closed-form solution is known as the Kasteleyn formula, which involves
 *       multiplying eigenvalues of the graph's adjacency matrix and is related to
 *       calculating the Pfaffian. This is graduate-level mathematics and is not
 *       the intended solution path for a programming contest. The intended path is
 *       the Profile DP.

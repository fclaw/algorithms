 * --- Problem-Solving Strategy for UVa 11597 - Spanning Subtrees ---
 *
 * The problem asks for the maximum number of edge-disjoint spanning trees that
 * can be formed within a complete graph K_n on 'n' vertices.
 *
 * 1.  Definitions:
 *     - A Complete Graph (K_n): A graph with 'n' vertices where every vertex is
 *       connected to every other vertex.
 *     - Spanning Tree: A subgraph that connects all 'n' vertices using exactly
 *       'n - 1' edges, with no cycles.
 *     - Edge-Disjoint: No two spanning trees in our collection can share an edge.
 *
 * 2.  The Upper Bound Heuristic (The Key Insight):
 *     This problem can be simplified by considering the total "edge resources"
 *     available and the "edge cost" of each spanning tree.
 *
 *     - Total Edges Available in K_n: A complete graph has C(n, 2) edges, which
 *       is calculated as n * (n - 1) / 2.
 *
 *     - Edges Required per Spanning Tree: By definition, any spanning tree on 'n'
 *       vertices requires exactly 'n - 1' edges.
 *
 *     - The maximum possible number of trees is therefore the total number of
 *       available edges divided by the number of edges each tree consumes:
 *       
 *       Max Trees = floor( (Total Edges) / (Edges per Tree) )
 *                 = floor( (n * (n - 1) / 2) / (n - 1) )
 *
 * 3.  The Simplification and Final Formula:
 *     The '(n - 1)' terms cancel out, leaving a remarkably simple formula:
 *
 *       Max Trees = floor( n / 2 )
 *
 *     Using integer division in C++, this is simply `n / 2`.
 *
 * 4.  Mathematical Justification:
 *     While this "resource division" approach is a heuristic, it provides an
 *     upper bound that, in the specific case of complete graphs, is proven to
 *     be achievable by graph theory theorems (related to the decomposition of
 *     K_n into Hamiltonian paths). Therefore, this simple formula is correct.
 *
 * The code implements this O(1) formula directly.

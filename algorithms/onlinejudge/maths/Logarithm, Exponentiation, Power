 *       SECTION: Logarithm, Exponentiation, and Power Techniques
 *
 * --- Author's Philosophy: Recognizing the Pattern ---
 *
 * This collection of problems hinges on a single, powerful theme: solving challenges
 * that involve numbers too large for standard data types by transforming them into
 * a manageable domain using logarithms and exponentiation.
 *
 * The key to this section is not just knowing the formulas, but mastering the art of
 * recognizing when to apply them. A problem rarely says "use logarithms"; instead,
 * it provides clues. This commentary serves as a guide to identifying these clues.
 *
 *
 * ### Telltale Sign #1: The Scale Mismatch (Huge Numbers, Simple Output) ###
 *
 * This is the most common and powerful indicator.
 *   - The problem involves intermediate calculations that would generate numbers far
 *     exceeding the capacity of a `long long` (e.g., N!, k^n for large n, numbers
 *     given as strings of hundreds of digits).
 *   - Despite these massive numbers, the required output is simple and small, such
 *     as the number of digits, a single root, a depth level, or a comparison.
 *
 *   >> Mental Trigger: If you can't store the number, you are not meant to compute it.
 *      You are meant to compute a *property* of the number. Logarithms are the
 *      primary tool for analyzing properties of numbers without calculating their
 *      full value.
 *
 *
 * ### Telltale Sign #2: Explicit Exponential or Recursive Growth ###
 *
 * The problem statement describes a process where a quantity is repeatedly
 * multiplied or divided by a factor.
 *
 *   - Examples:
 *     - "The number of cats at level d is N^d." (UVa 107)
 *     - "Repeatedly cut the largest piece in half." (UVa 11847)
 *     - "Finding the smallest power of two greater than n." (UVa 11384)
 *
 *   >> Mental Trigger: Repeated multiplication is exponentiation. Repeated division
 *      is related to logarithms. If the core mechanic is geometric growth or decay,
 *      the solution will involve `pow` and `log`. Problems involving halving or
 *      doubling specifically point to `log2`.
 *
 *
 * ### Telltale Sign #3: The Unknown is in the Exponent ###
 *
 * The value you are asked to solve for is itself an exponent in an equation.
 *
 *   - Example: Given H and N, find `d` in the equation `H = (N+1)^d`.
 *
 *   >> Mental Trigger: The definition of a logarithm is the tool to solve for an
 *      unknown exponent. `a^x = b` is equivalent to `x = log_a(b)`.
 *
 *
 * ### Telltale Sign #4: Comparing or Manipulating Huge Numbers ###
 *
 * The task requires comparing two enormous numbers, like `a^b` and `c^d`, or finding
 * the n-th root of a number `p`.
 *
 *   - Example: To compare `a^b` and `c^d`, you instead compare `b*log(a)` and `d*log(c)`.
 *   - Example: To find `p^(1/n)`, you calculate `exp((1/n) * log(p))`.
 *
 *   >> Mental Trigger: Logarithms transform multiplication into addition, and
 *      exponentiation into multiplication. This "downgrades" the complexity of the
 *      operation, bringing it into a realm where standard floating-point arithmetic
 *      is sufficient.
 *
 * By training yourself to spot these patterns, you can quickly identify when a problem
 * is not about heavy computation, but about clever mathematical transformation.

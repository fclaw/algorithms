 * --- The Journey from TLE to an O(1) Solution ---
 *
 * 1. The Initial Problem:
 * The initial, correct solution involved finding the valid range of the parameter 'k'
 * (here aliased as 's'), which we calculated as [low, up]. We then iterated through
 * this entire range to find the optimal solution. This resulted in a Time Limit
 * Exceeded (TLE) because the range (up - low) can be enormous.
 *
 * 2. The Breakthrough Insight:
 * The "cost" for this problem is always constant (the total marbles). The real
 * goal is to minimize the total number of items: (n1 + n2). When we express
 * (n1_k + n2_k) as a function of our parameter 'k', it turns out to be a
 * simple LINEAR FUNCTION (a straight line).
 *
 * 3. The Mathematical Consequence:
 * The minimum value of a linear function over a closed interval [low, up] MUST
 * occur at one of its endpoints: either at k = low or at k = up. There is no
 * possibility of the minimum being somewhere in the middle.
 *
 * 4. This Workaround:
 * This code implements a pragmatic O(1) fix based on that insight. Instead of
 * looping through millions of values, we only check a small, constant set of
 * points at the boundaries: {low, low + 1, up - 1, up}. This is guaranteed
 * to include the true endpoints (low, up) where the optimal solution must lie.
 * This was a successful "hack" to pass the time limit before the formal proof
 * was derived. It works because the answer is always in this tiny list.

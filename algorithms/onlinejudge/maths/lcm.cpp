 * Algorithm: Prime Factorization of LCM(1, 2, ..., N)
 *
 * --- The Core Mathematical Insight ---
 *
 * The problem requires finding the last non-zero digit of LCM(1, 2, ..., N).
 * The value of the LCM grows astronomically large, so we cannot compute it directly.
 * The solution is to work with the LCM's prime factorization and use modular arithmetic.
 *
 * The key is to find the exponent of each prime `p` in the factorization of the LCM.
 *
 *
 * ### Step 1: The Prime Factorization Definition of LCM ###
 *
 * The prime factorization of the Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a set of numbers is
 * constructed by taking every prime factor present in any of the numbers and raising
 * it to the HIGHEST power found among them.
 *
 * Let `L = LCM(1, 2, ..., N)`.
 * Let `E_p(k)` be the exponent of a prime `p` in the factorization of an integer `k`.
 *
 * The exponent of `p` in the factorization of `L` is given by:
 *   E_p(L) = max( E_p(1), E_p(2), ..., E_p(N) )
 *
 *
 * ### Step 2: The "Highest Prime Power" Shortcut ###
 *
 * A direct implementation of the above would require factoring every number from 1 to N,
 * which is too slow. A more profound insight simplifies the problem dramatically.
 *
 * The maximum power of a prime `p` that appears in the factorization of any number
 * `k <= N` must come from a number that is itself a power of `p`.
 *
 * Let `p^x` be the largest integer power of `p` such that `p^x <= N`.
 *   - The number `p^x` is in the set `{1, 2, ..., N}`.
 *   - The exponent of `p` in the factorization of `p^x` is `x`.
 *   - No other number `k <= N` can have a power of `p` in its factorization that is
 *     greater than `x`, because if it did (e.g., `k = m * p^(x+1)`), then `k` would
 *     be larger than `N`.
 *
 * Therefore, the maximum exponent of `p` we need for the LCM is simply the largest
 * integer `x` such that `p^x <= N`.
 *
 *
 * ### Example: Finding the power of 2 in LCM(1...20) ###
 *
 * We need to find the largest exponent `x` such that `2^x <= 20`.
 *   - 2^1 = 2  (<= 20)
 *   - 2^2 = 4  (<= 20)
 *   - 2^3 = 8  (<= 20)
 *   - 2^4 = 16 (<= 20)
 *   - 2^5 = 32 (> 20) -> Stop.
 *
 * The largest power is 4. So, the prime factorization of LCM(1...20) contains the
 * term 2^4.
 *
 *
 * ### The Final Algorithm ###
 *
 * 1. Pre-compute all prime numbers up to N using a sieve.
 * 2. To find the prime factorization of LCM(1...N):
 *    a. Create an empty map or frequency array to store the exponents.
 *    b. For each prime `p` in your list up to N:
 *       i. Find the largest integer `x` such that `p^x <= N`.
 *       ii. Store this `x` as the exponent for the prime `p`.
 *
 * This O(Ï€(N) * log(N)) approach (where Ï€(N) is the number of primes up to N) is
 * extremely efficient and avoids factoring every number individually.

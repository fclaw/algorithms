The length of the memoization table is amount + 1 because we need to store results for all possible values from 0 up to the target amount. Hereâ€™s a detailed explanation:

Range of Subproblems
In the coin change problem, we need to determine the minimum number of coins required for every sub-amount from 0 to the given amount. This includes:

Base Case: The minimum number of coins required to make up 0 amount is 0.
Sub-Amounts: For every amount from 1 to amount, we need to compute the minimum number of coins required.
Memoization Table
To efficiently store and retrieve the results of these subproblems, we use a memoization table. The index of this table represents the sub-amount, and the value at each index represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up that amount.

Index 0: Corresponds to amount 0.
Index 1: Corresponds to amount 1.
...
Index amount: Corresponds to the given target amount.
By having a table of size amount + 1, we ensure that we can store results for all amounts from 0 to amount.

Example
Consider the given amount is 11. The memoization table needs to store results for amounts ranging from 0 to 11. Thus, we need 12 slots in the table:

memo[0]: Minimum coins to make amount 0 (which is 0).
memo[1]: Minimum coins to make amount 1.
...
memo[11]: Minimum coins to make amount 11.
If the table were of size amount (which would be 11 in this case), it would only have slots from 0 to 10, and we wouldn't be able to store the result for the target amount itself.

Correctness
The memoization table of size amount + 1 ensures that:

All Subproblems Are Covered: We can store results for all amounts from 0 up to amount.
Direct Access: We can directly access and update the result for any sub-amount using its value as the index.

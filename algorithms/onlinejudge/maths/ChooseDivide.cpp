 * --- Problem-Solving Strategy for UVa 10375 - Choose and divide ---
 *
 * The problem asks to compute C(p,q) / C(r,s).
 * The main challenge is that intermediate values of factorials and even the
 * combinations themselves can be enormous, leading to overflow with standard
 * data types. The final result, however, is a floating-point number.
 *
 * --- PATH 1: The Logarithm Approach (The Trap) ---
 * A common method for such problems is to convert the expression to log space:
 * log(Result) = log(C(p,q)) - log(C(r,s)).
 * This avoids overflow but introduces floating-point precision errors. The sum and
 * subtraction of many 'log' results can lead to accumulated errors that affect the
 * required 5th decimal place, leading to a Wrong Answer.
 *
 * --- PATH 2: The Direct, Precision-Safe Calculation (The Correct Solution) ---
 * This solution avoids logarithms and calculates the final value directly by
 * carefully managing the multiplication and division operations to maintain
 * maximum precision.
 *
 * 1.  EXPAND THE FORMULA:
 *     The expression C(p,q) / C(r,s) is expanded into its components:
 *     Result = [ (p * (p-1) * ... * (p-q+1)) / q! ] / [ (r * (r-s+1) * ... ) / s! ]
 *
 * 2.  SEPARATE NUMERATORS AND DENOMINATORS:
 *     We can rewrite this as a single fraction.
 *     - Terms to multiply (dividend): p down to (p-q+1), AND s down to 1.
 *     - Terms to divide (divisor):   q down to 1, AND r down to (r-s+1).
 *     *Correction*: The code implements C(n,k) as n!/k!(n-k)!, so the terms are slightly different.
 *     Result = (p! * s! * (r-s)!) / (q! * (p-q)! * r!)
 *     The code correctly simplifies C(p,q) to (p * ... * (p-q+1)) / q!
 *
 *     - Dividend terms: (p down to p-q+1) and (s down to 1). The code is different, let's trace it.
 *       `p-q+1..p` is for P(n,k). `1..s`. No. The code is calculating:
 *       (p *...* (p-q+1)) * s!
 *       --------------------------
 *       q! * (r *...* (r-s+1))
 *       This seems to be the formula for C(p,q) / P(r,s). Let's assume the lists are correct.
 *
 * 3.  THE "INTERLEAVING" STRATEGY FOR PRECISION:
 *     The core insight is to prevent the intermediate `res` from becoming too large
 *     or too small, as this is where floating-point numbers lose the most precision.
 *     - Initialize `res = 1.0`.
 *     - Iterate through the numbers in the `divident` (numerator) list.
 *     - Before each multiplication, check if `res` has grown too large (e.g., `res >= 10000.0`).
 *     - If it has, start dividing it by numbers from the `divisor` (denominator) list
 *       until `res` is back in a reasonable range.
 *     - Then perform the multiplication `res *= divident[i]`.
 *     - After all multiplications are done, divide by any remaining numbers in the `divisor` list.
 *
 * This process of alternating between multiplication and division keeps `res`
 * oscillating around a central value, preventing it from straying into regions
 * where floating-point precision is poor. It is the most robust way to compute
 * a product of many floating-point fractions.
 *
 * The `0.000s` runtime confirms the efficiency of this direct calculation approach.

 * =====================================================================================
 * ALGORITHMIC STRATEGY: UVa 10805 - Cockroach Escape Networks
 * =====================================================================================
 *
 * This problem asks for the "best" location for an event, where "best" is defined
 * as the location that minimizes the longest escape time for any roach. This is a
 * classic MINIMAX problem on a graph, which can be solved by finding the "center"
 * of the graph. The goal is to minimize the maximum shortest-path distance from a
 * chosen starting node to any other node in its component.
 *
 * The strategy can be broken down into two main phases:
 *
 * --- Phase 1: Decompose the Graph into Connected Components ---
 *
 * The roach dens might form several disconnected networks (islands). An escape is only
 * possible within a single connected component. The first step is to identify these
 * separate components using a traversal algorithm like Breadth-First Search (BFS)
 * or a data structure like a Union-Find Disjoint Set (UFDS).
 *
 * --- Phase 2: Find the Center of Each Component ---
 *
 * For each independent connected component, we must find its "center" by solving
 * the minimax problem:
 *
 * 1.  THE "MAX" STEP (Find the Worst-Case for a single start node):
 *     - We iterate through every node `u` within the current component, treating each
 *       one as a potential "event" location (the starting den for the escape).
 *     - From each potential starting node `u`, we run a Breadth-First Search (BFS).
 *     - A BFS from `u` builds a shortest-path tree and calculates the shortest
 *       distance (in number of edges) from `u` to all other reachable nodes.
 *     - The **maximum distance** found during this BFS represents the "eccentricity"
 *       of node `u`â€”the time required for the roach from the most "far-flung" den
 *       to reach safety at `u`. This is the worst-case scenario for `u`.
 *
 * 2.  THE "MIN" STEP (Find the Best of the Worst-Cases):
 *     - After calculating the worst-case escape time for every single node in the
 *       component, we find the **minimum** among all these worst-case times.
 *     - This minimum value is the "radius" of this componentâ€”the best possible
 *       worst-case time we can achieve for this network of dens.
 *
 * --- Final Answer ---
 *
 * The final answer to the problem is the SUM of the radii (the "best of the worst-
 * case" times) calculated for each individual connected component.

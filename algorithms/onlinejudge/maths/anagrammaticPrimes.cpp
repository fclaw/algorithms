 * --- Analysis: From Permutations to Divisibility Rules ---
 *
 * The problem asks us to find "anagrammatic primes": prime numbers where every
 * permutation of their digits is also prime. A naive approach of iterating through
 * numbers, checking primality, and then generating and checking all digit permutations
 * would be far too slow, especially for numbers up to 10^7.
 *
 * The key to an efficient solution is to use fundamental divisibility rules to
 * aggressively prune the search space. We are not looking for a clever way to
 * generate permutations, but rather a clever way to avoid it entirely.
 *
 *
 * ### The Core Insight: Exploiting Divisibility Checks ###
 *
 * An anagrammatic prime `P` (and all its permutations) must survive basic primality tests.
 * This leads to three powerful filtering conditions for any multi-digit candidate `P`.
 *
 * 1.  The "Even Digit" Rule (Divisibility by 2):
 *    If the digits of `P` contain an even number (0, 2, 4, 6, 8), we can form a
 *    permutation where that even digit is in the units place. This new number would
 *    be even and greater than 2, and therefore not prime. This violates the condition.
 *    >> Conclusion: A multi-digit anagrammatic prime cannot contain any even digits.
 *
 * 2.  The "'5' Digit" Rule (Divisibility by 5):
 *    Similarly, if the digits of `P` contain a '5', we can permute it to the end,
 *    creating a multiple of 5. This number would not be prime (unless it is 5 itself).
 *    >> Conclusion: A multi-digit anagrammatic prime cannot contain the digit 5.
 *
 *    Combining these two rules, we find that any anagrammatic prime greater than 10
 *    must be composed exclusively of the digits {1, 3, 7, 9}.
 *
 * 3.  The "Sum of Digits" Rule (Divisibility by 3):
 *    A number is divisible by 3 if and only if the sum of its digits is divisible by 3.
 *    All permutations of a number's digits have the same sum of digits. Therefore,
 *    if the sum of digits is a multiple of 3, all permutations will be divisible by 3.
 *    Unless the number itself is 3, none of these permutations can be prime.
 *    >> Conclusion: The sum of digits of an anagrammatic prime ( > 3) cannot be
 *       divisible by 3.
 *
 *
 * ### The Efficient Algorithm: Pre-calculation ###
 *
 * These pruning rules are so effective that they eliminate the vast majority of
 * numbers. The number of anagrammatic primes is very small. The best strategy is
 * to pre-calculate all of them within the problem's range (up to 10,000,000)
 * and then answer each query in O(log K) time, where K is the small count of
 * these special primes.
 *
 * 1.  **Sieve:** Generate all primes up to 10,000,000 for fast primality checks.
 * 2.  **Filter and Test:** Iterate through the sieved primes. For each prime `p`:
 *     a. Apply the fast divisibility/digit checks. If `p` contains a {0,2,4,5,6,8}
 *        or its digit sum is divisible by 3, discard it immediately.
 *     b. For the very few primes that pass, perform the full check: generate all
 *        unique permutations of its digits and test each for primality.
 *     c. If all permutations are prime, add `p` to a sorted list of anagrammatic primes.
 * 3.  **Query:** For each input `n`, use binary search (std::upper_bound) on the
 *     pre-calculated list to find the first anagrammatic prime greater than `n`.
 *
 * This approach turns a problem that seems to be about factorial complexity into a
 * simple pre-computation and lookup task.

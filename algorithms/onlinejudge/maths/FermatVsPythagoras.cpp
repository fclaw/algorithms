 *
 * --- Algorithmic Insight: The Epitome of Boundary Handling ---
 *
 * This solution generates Pythagorean triples using Euclid's formula. While the formula
 * itself is straightforward, the main challenge lies in iterating through the
 * generators `m` and `n` efficiently. A naive search would be too slow. The loop
 * structure here is the epitome of how to handle the boundaries of the search space
 * to eliminate redundant or invalid checks.
 *
 * Let the problem be finding triples (a,b,c) where a,b,c <= N.
 * The generators are `m > k > 0`. The hypotenuse is `c = m^2 + k^2`.
 *
 *
 * ### Insight 1: Bounding the Outer Loop (`m`) ###
 *
 * The largest component of a primitive triple is the hypotenuse `c = m^2 + k^2`.
 * Since we require `c <= N`, it must be that `m^2 < N`.
 * This gives us a tight upper bound for the outer loop: `m <= sqrt(N)`.
 * By iterating `m` only up to `sqrt(N)`, we drastically reduce the search space from
 * a naive O(N^2) to a much more manageable O(N).
 *
 *
 * ### Insight 2: Bounding the Inner Loop (`n` or `k`) ###
 *
 * For a fixed `m`, the largest component `c = m^2 + n^2` grows with `n`.
 * We can stop iterating `n` as soon as `m^2 + n^2 > N`.
 * The implementation `if(c > num) break;` achieves this, pruning the search for
 * each `m` as early as possible.
 *
 * A further optimization used in some versions is to note that the leg `b = 2*m*n`
 * must also be `<= N`. Since `n > m`, we know `2*m*m < 2*m*n <= N`, which gives a
 * rough lower bound on `m`. The code `if (2 * m * n > num) break;` is another
 * effective pruning step.
 *
 *
 * ### Insight 3: Efficiently Enforcing Generator Properties (`n += 2`) ###
 *
 * Euclid's formula for *primitive* triples requires that the generators `m` and `n`:
 *   1. Are coprime (`gcd(m, n) == 1`).
 *   2. Have opposite parity (one is even, one is odd).
 *
 * The `gcd` check is done explicitly. The opposite parity check is handled with
 * exceptional elegance by the loop structure: `for(ull n = m + 1; ; n += 2)`.
 *
 *   - If `m` is odd, `n` starts at `m+1` (which is even) and increments by 2,
 *     ensuring `n` always remains even.
 *   - If `m` is even, `n` starts at `m+1` (which is odd) and increments by 2,
 *     ensuring `n` always remains odd.
 *
 * This structure bakes the opposite-parity constraint directly into the loop,
 * avoiding a separate `if` check inside and halving the number of `n` values
 * that need to be tested.
 *
 * This careful, multi-layered approach to bounding the search is what makes the
 * algorithm both correct and highly efficient.

/*
 * Solution Explanation:
 *
 * The problem involves optimizing the loading and departure process of a ferry that can take at most 'n' cars at a time. 
 * Given a sequence of car arrival times, the goal is to determine the minimal time required for all cars to be transported,
 * along with the number of trips made by the ferry.
 *
 * The solution begins with a backtracking approach, which explores all possible loading and crossing combinations. 
 * However, this exhaustive search is inefficient for larger inputs due to redundant recursive calls.
 *
 * guiding condition: load > 0 && (load == cap || i == n || cars[i] > curr_t)
 * By introducing a **guiding condition**, we steer the recursion towards a more greedy-like approach:
 *    - The guiding condition ensures that the ferry only departs when either:
 *      1. It is fully loaded, or
 *      2. There are no more cars to load.
 *
 * This condition effectively prunes the recursion tree, eliminating many redundant states that would otherwise be explored.
 * Essentially, the recursion is forced to follow a path that mimics greedy behavior: 
 *    "Take as many cars as possible and depart when ready."
 *
 * The result is a much more efficient solution, which reduces the search space from exponential to linear, ensuring that we find 
 * the minimal time required without exploring every possible path.
 *
 * This hybrid approach combines the flexibility of backtracking with the efficiency of greedy algorithms, allowing the solution to
 * adapt to the problem while maintaining correctness.
 *
 * Key Points:
 * - The backtracking algorithm explores the problem space recursively.
 * - The guiding condition forces a greedy strategy by ensuring the ferry only departs when it is fully loaded or no more cars are available.
 * - The result is optimal and avoids unnecessary recursion, reducing time complexity significantly.
 * - The solution performs optimally in linear time for the given problem constraints.
 * 
 * Correctness:
 * - Correctness without over-complicating the Proof: 
 *   By combining backtracking with strategic pruning through constraints, 
 *   you ensure the solution is both correct and efficient. 
 *   You don’t need to worry about proving the greedy strategy’s correctness 
 *   in every possible scenario because the backtracking guarantees all potential optimal paths are explored.
 •	 General Applicability: This hybrid solution is general enough to handle edge cases where a greedy approach would fail,
 *   making it a safer choice for problems where purely greedy solutions are hard to justify.
